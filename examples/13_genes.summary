6348	This locus represents a small inducible cytokine. The encoded protein, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, plays a role in inflammatory responses through binding to the receptors CCR1, CCR4 and CCR5. Polymorphisms at this locus may be associated with both resistance and susceptibility to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]
3440	This gene is a member of the alpha interferon gene cluster on chromosome 9. The encoded cytokine is a member of the type I interferon family that is produced in response to viral infection as a key part of the innate immune response with potent antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties. This cytokine, like other type I interferons, binds a plasma membrane receptor made of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 that is ubiquitously expressed, and thus is able to act on virtually all body cells. The encoded protein is effective in reducing the symptoms and duration of the common cold and in treating many types of cancer, including some hematological malignancies and solid tumors. A deficiency of type I interferon in the blood is thought to be a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and may provide a rationale for a combined therapeutic approach. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]
6372	The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family. The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

55600	Enables calcium ion binding activity; identical protein binding activity; and oligosaccharide binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of glucose import; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation; and protein homotrimerization. Located in extracellular exosome. Part of receptor complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
221785	This gene encodes a protein that bears some similarity to zinc finger proteins, which are involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but the full-length nature for most of them has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
930	This gene encodes a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. Expression of this cell surface protein is restricted to B cell lymphocytes. This protein is a reliable marker for pre-B cells but its expression diminishes during terminal B cell differentiation in antibody secreting plasma cells. The protein has two N-terminal extracellular Ig-like domains separated by a non-Ig-like domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This protein forms a complex with several membrane proteins including complement receptor type 2 (CD21) and tetraspanin (CD81) and this complex reduces the threshold for antigen-initiated B cell activation. Activation of this B-cell antigen receptor complex activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway and the subsequent release of intracellular stores of calcium ions. This protein is a target of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells used in the treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia. Mutations in this gene are associated with the disease common variable immunodeficiency 3 (CVID3) which results in a failure of B-cell differentiation and impaired secretion of immunoglobulins. CVID3 is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, an inability to mount an antibody response to antigen, and recurrent bacterial infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]
5163	Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and is one of the major enzymes responsible for the regulation of homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels in mammals. The enzymatic activity is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. Phosphorylation of PDH by a specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) results in inactivation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]
151963	Enables cadherin binding activity. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
5126	This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may increase susceptibility to myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. This gene may also play a role in tumor development and progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]
79971	Enables Wnt-protein binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of cell communication and protein transport. Located in several cellular components, including Golgi apparatus; early endosome; and endoplasmic reticulum membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
2923	This gene encodes a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that interacts with lectin chaperones calreticulin and calnexin to modulate folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. The protein was once thought to be a phospholipase; however, it has been demonstrated that the protein actually has protein disulfide isomerase activity. It is thought that complexes of lectins and this protein mediate protein folding by promoting formation of disulfide bonds in their glycoprotein substrates. This protein also functions as a molecular chaperone that prevents the formation of protein aggregates. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]
9349	Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L14P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. This gene has been referred to as rpL17 because the encoded protein shares amino acid identity with ribosomal protein L17 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, its official symbol is RPL23. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
